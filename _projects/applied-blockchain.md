title: Applied Blockchain
subtitle: Redesign of the website of a blockchain consultancy and development startup
body: This project was part of the creation of the complete brading of a startup. I was brought onboard, alongside another designer, to create from scratch what would become the company's brand identity. One of the biggest part of that job was to rebrand the website.
