subtitle: Redesign of a website
body: This project was part of the creation of the complete branding of Applied Blockchain,
  a blockchain consultancy and development startup. I was brought onboard, alongside
  another designer, to create from scratch what would become the company's brand identity.
  One of the biggest part of that job was to rebrand the website.
