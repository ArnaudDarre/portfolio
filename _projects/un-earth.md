<p>[UN]EARTH offers us a vision. One that a civilization from space is going to lay on our society, our lifestyle, our behaviours. A project that uses sience-fiction to speak about the problems in our world, a glimpse that helps us question its methods. This project is a graphic anthology, a history book that tells us a tale, a new myth of world destruction.</p>
<p>The immersion had to be complete. The aliens have their own writing, a limitless curiosity. They offer us their understanding of our world as they discovered it, and the harvested digital relics, damaged by time.</p>
