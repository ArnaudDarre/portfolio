    <p>[un]earth offers us a vision. One that a civilization from space is going to lay on our society, our lifestyle, our behaviours. A project that uses sience-fiction to speak about the problems in our world, a glimpse that helps us question its methods. This project is a graphic anthology, a history book that tells us a tale, a new myth of world destruction.</p>
    <p>The immersion had to be complete. The aliens have their own writing, a limitless curiosity. They offer us their understanding of our world as they discovered it, and the harvested digital relics, damaged by time.</p>

    <p>This project has been particularly fun because it blended a lot of different mediums and skills. And it allowed me to dive into written storytelling, something that I had only experienced graphically before.</p>
