        <p>Before creating the screens, I designed the user flows, and how the two systems (admin and warehouse) would work together. I then designed the wireframes and prototype using Figma to showcase the flows to the client.</p>
        <p>The app is composed of two systems, a deskop admin platform and an app for the management of stock by warehouse workers. You can experience the two prototypes in action below.</p>
