## Dependencies & Methodologies

### SASS

Styling is powered with Sass, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
Style files are located in the assets/_sass folder. You don't need to run any additional command to compile, it does it automatically with `jekyll serve`

- [Install Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)
